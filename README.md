# Nostr-Run-App
Rough Draft of a run tracker for nostr enthusiasts

**Why**
- I'm a nostr only freak and i've left apple music for wavlake. I use a running app called nike run club, and while running i'm fiddling with my phone going back and forth between wavlake and the running app, and then after the run i'm taking screenshots of my run and posting it on nostr. I see other people taking screenshots and could imagine them fiddling with music controls as well.
- I want a nostr run club app that allows me to track my runs and save them to my nsecs history, I want the app to show my wavlake playlists, and I want to one click post my run to nostr after i'm done.
- My lightning node has gone down recently, so i've started using more e-cash stuff in the meantime.....I need a android e-cash wallet that supports NIP60/61 and sign in with amber....because I dont think one exists.....and I would like for one to exist.

**Roadmap**
Level 1 (Basic Features)
- Start Run/Pause Run/Stop Run 
- View Run History 
- Nostr Login
- Post run to Nostr

Level 2 (In Depth Nostr Features)

- NIP60/61 Wallet
- Runstr Chatroom
- E-Cash Rewards/Nutzaps

Level 3 (Finalizing app main functionality)
- Goals and Achievement Badges
- Run Clubs
- Team and individual races


Level 4 (Monetization path)
- Coaches
  - Fitness people on nostr can pay 3k sats a month to to be a sponsored coach
  - "This weeks rewards are brought to you buy (Insert Nostr Coach in Coach Tab)
- Merch 
  - Printify store selling workout related Merch
- Sponsored Tracks
  - Artists can pay 3k sats a month to sponsor workout tracks

Currently the app is deployed on https://runnostr.replit.app/ with minimal functionality and is a noob plebdevs work in progress.
